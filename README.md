### **1. Introduction – Why jobs matter**  
Good afternoon, examiner. Today I’m going to talk about **jobs** – one of the most important parts of adult life. A job is not just about **earning money** to pay **bills** and live; it gives us **financial independence**, helps us **develop skills**, and makes us feel **useful in society**. As Ronald Dunn said: *“Doing nothing is the most tiresome job in the world because you cannot quit and rest.”*  
While **full-time employment** is still the standard (**eight-hour working day**, **working week**), many choose **part-time jobs**, **self-employment**, **freelance work**, or **temporary contracts** to gain **flexibility** and **work-life balance**.

The **gig economy** is huge now. Young people **run their own business** on apps – drive for Uber, deliver food, freelance online.

I’d **travel the world** with a camera – rainforests, Arctic, African savannah. I’d **shoot documentaries** about endangered animals, work with *scientists*, *local communities*, and *conservation teams*.  
Back home, I’d **edit** in a small studio, add music, voice-over, and screen films on Netflix or BBC.  
It’s **physically demanding** – long **expeditions**, bad weather, danger (snakes, storms). But one film can **save a species**, change laws, or inspire millions.  
Pay? **Grants**, **sponsorship**, **streaming deals** – not sky-high, but the **adventure**, **impact**, and **freedom** are priceless. I’d never **quit** – this is my **passion**.
